# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive documentation guide that details the entire Spec/Planning process used by Kiro AI, including the methodology, thought processes, best practices, and actionable steps for both planning and execution phases. The guide will serve as both educational material and a reference for developers wanting to understand and implement systematic feature development approaches.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a detailed guide on the Spec/Planning methodology, so that I can understand the systematic approach to feature development and apply it to my own projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the guide THEN the system SHALL provide a complete overview of the three-phase spec process (Requirements, Design, Tasks)
2. WHEN a user reads the methodology section THEN the system SHALL explain the reasoning behind each phase and how they build upon each other
3. WHEN a user reviews the process steps THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable instructions for each phase
4. IF a user wants to understand the workflow THEN the system SHALL include visual diagrams showing the process flow and decision points

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed prompting strategies and techniques, so that I can effectively communicate with AI systems during the spec creation process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user needs prompting guidance THEN the system SHALL provide specific prompt templates for each phase of spec development
2. WHEN a user wants to improve their prompting THEN the system SHALL include best practices for clear, effective communication with AI systems
3. WHEN a user encounters common issues THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance and alternative approaches
4. IF a user needs examples THEN the system SHALL include sample prompts and expected responses for each phase

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want insights into the AI's reasoning and thought processes, so that I can better understand how decisions are made during spec development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to understand AI reasoning THEN the system SHALL document the decision-making frameworks used in each phase
2. WHEN a user reviews the thought process THEN the system SHALL explain how requirements are analyzed and prioritized
3. WHEN a user studies design decisions THEN the system SHALL provide examples of how technical choices are evaluated
4. IF a user needs implementation guidance THEN the system SHALL explain how tasks are broken down and sequenced

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive resources and references, so that I can deepen my understanding of spec-driven development and related methodologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user seeks additional learning THEN the system SHALL provide curated resources on requirements engineering, system design, and project planning
2. WHEN a user wants to explore standards THEN the system SHALL reference industry standards like EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
3. WHEN a user needs tools and templates THEN the system SHALL provide downloadable templates and checklists
4. IF a user wants to stay updated THEN the system SHALL include references to current best practices and emerging methodologies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want practical execution guidance, so that I can effectively implement the planned features using the spec-driven approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user begins implementation THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step guidance for executing tasks from the spec
2. WHEN a user encounters implementation challenges THEN the system SHALL offer troubleshooting strategies and alternative approaches
3. WHEN a user wants to maintain quality THEN the system SHALL include testing strategies and validation techniques
4. IF a user needs to adapt the process THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on customizing the methodology for different project types

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want examples and case studies, so that I can see the spec process applied to real-world scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants practical examples THEN the system SHALL include complete spec examples from simple to complex features
2. WHEN a user studies implementation patterns THEN the system SHALL provide case studies showing successful spec-driven development
3. WHEN a user needs inspiration THEN the system SHALL include examples from different domains and project types
4. IF a user wants to learn from mistakes THEN the system SHALL include common pitfalls and how to avoid them
