# Design Document

## Overview

The Spec Process Guide will be implemented as a comprehensive documentation system that provides both theoretical understanding and practical guidance for spec-driven development. The guide will be structured as a multi-section document that can serve as both a learning resource and a reference manual, with clear navigation, practical examples, and actionable templates.

## Architecture

The documentation will follow a layered information architecture:

1. **Conceptual Layer**: High-level methodology and philosophy
2. **Process Layer**: Step-by-step workflows and procedures  
3. **Practical Layer**: Templates, examples, and hands-on guidance
4. **Reference Layer**: Resources, troubleshooting, and advanced topics

The guide will be implemented as structured Markdown documents with clear hierarchical organization, cross-references, and embedded diagrams using Mermaid syntax.

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Documentation Components

#### 1. Methodology Overview
- **Purpose**: Establish foundational understanding of spec-driven development
- **Content**: Philosophy, benefits, when to use, comparison with other approaches
- **Format**: Narrative explanation with supporting diagrams

#### 2. Three-Phase Process Guide
- **Purpose**: Detailed walkthrough of Requirements → Design → Tasks workflow
- **Content**: Step-by-step instructions, decision points, validation criteria
- **Format**: Structured process documentation with flowcharts

#### 3. AI Reasoning Framework
- **Purpose**: Transparency into decision-making processes and thought patterns
- **Content**: Decision trees, evaluation criteria, prioritization methods
- **Format**: Explanatory text with examples and case studies

#### 4. Prompting Strategy Guide
- **Purpose**: Effective communication techniques for AI collaboration
- **Content**: Prompt templates, best practices, common patterns
- **Format**: Template library with usage examples

#### 5. Implementation Execution Guide
- **Purpose**: Practical guidance for task execution and project management
- **Content**: Execution strategies, quality assurance, troubleshooting
- **Format**: Procedural documentation with checklists

#### 6. Resource Library
- **Purpose**: Curated collection of references and learning materials
- **Content**: Standards documentation, tool recommendations, further reading
- **Format**: Annotated bibliography with categorization

### Supporting Components

#### Templates and Checklists
- Requirements template (EARS format)
- Design document template
- Task breakdown template
- Review checklists for each phase

#### Visual Aids
- Process flow diagrams (Mermaid)
- Decision trees
- Example spec structures
- Before/after comparisons

### Content Organization Model
Each major section will follow a consistent structure:
- **Introduction**: Purpose and scope
- **Core Content**: Main information with examples
- **Practical Application**: How-to guidance and templates
- **Validation**: Checklists and quality criteria
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

## Error Handling

### Content Quality Assurance
- **Accuracy Validation**: Cross-reference with actual workflow implementation
- **Completeness Checks**: Ensure all requirements are addressed
- **Consistency Review**: Maintain uniform terminology and formatting
- **Usability Testing**: Verify examples work as documented

### User Experience Considerations
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with overview, drill down to details
- **Multiple Entry Points**: Support different user needs and experience levels
- **Clear Navigation**: Table of contents, cross-references, search-friendly structure
- **Actionable Content**: Every section should provide concrete next steps

## Testing Strategy

### Content Validation
1. **Requirement Traceability**: Verify each requirement is addressed in the documentation
2. **Example Verification**: Test all provided examples and templates
3. **Process Walkthrough**: Execute the documented processes to verify accuracy
4. **User Scenario Testing**: Validate against different user personas and use cases

### Quality Metrics
- **Completeness**: All workflow phases documented with sufficient detail
- **Accuracy**: Examples and processes work as described
- **Usability**: Users can successfully follow the guidance
- **Maintainability**: Documentation can be easily updated as processes evolve

### Review Process
1. **Technical Review**: Verify accuracy of process descriptions and examples
2. **Editorial Review**: Ensure clarity, consistency, and readability
3. **User Testing**: Validate with developers unfamiliar with the process
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Incorporate feedback and improve based on usage

## Implementation Approach

The guide will be developed incrementally:

1. **Foundation**: Core methodology and process documentation
2. **Enhancement**: AI reasoning insights and prompting strategies  
3. **Practical Tools**: Templates, examples, and execution guidance
4. **Resource Integration**: Comprehensive reference materials and links
5. **Polish**: Visual aids, navigation improvements, and final validation

Each section will be self-contained but cross-referenced, allowing users to consume the content in different ways based on their needs and experience level.
